SETUP GUIDE (local.sh and make prod)

Make sure to install the requirements in the root (topmost) folder:

pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt

Sometimes you need to run this as ./local.sh misses it:
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH


Then run:
./local.sh

or

sh local.sh

From the root folder.  If it runs, the setup is working.


HOW TO RUN FRONT END INSTRUCTIONS:
cd flask_react
npm install
npm start

Tip: When adding new js libraries to react, try to figure them out all beforehand and see if they work together.
Saves a HUGE amount of headache in my experience.
