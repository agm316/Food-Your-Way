# FOOD YOUR WAY

Description:
A recipe database that makes looking up recipes by filters simple and easy for everyone. Enabling search by lifestyle, diet, or even ingredients (to either include or exclude specific ingredients). Utilizes MongoDB utilizing either MongoDB atlas or a local server running in a docker container.

ROUGH USER FLOW:
- able to request recipe search using specific filters and receive back list of matching recipes
- once a recipe is chosen, user is able to receive the specific details of that recipe and instructions

TO DO:
- update HOWTOSETUP.txt to account for new MongoDB
- finish db and connect it to "front-end" (also WIP)
- make recipe search bar (setup react for UI after this works)
- will add specific filters (certain amount of calories, allergies, vegetarian/vegan options)

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (will be added in Spring 2023):
- Frontend (GUI)
