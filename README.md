# FOOD YOUR WAY


HATEOAS BRANCH:
Currently using this branch to test HATEOAS integration.  A more polished version will be added to the final product.


Description:
A recipe database that makes looking up recipes by filters simple and easy for everyone. Enabling search by lifestyle, diet, or even ingredients (to either include or exclude specific ingredients). 

ROUGH USER FLOW:
- able to request recipe search using specific filters and receive back list of matching recipes
- once a recipe is chosen, user is able to receive the specific details of that recipe and instructions

TO DO:
- make database
- add HATEOAS / react setup
- make recipe scraper (script to populate database)
- make recipe search bar (setup react for UI after this works)
- create automated testing of API
- will add specific filters (certain amount of calories, allergies, vegeterian/vegan options)

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (not currently working on):
- Frontend (GUI)
