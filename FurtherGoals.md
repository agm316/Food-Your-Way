# Further Goals for this semester:
* Adding a front end to our API.
Further developing a UI using react to make it easier to interact with our API (add stack navigator next)
* Splitting our front end from backend.
This will make it easier to develop and run them together (like HATEOAS)
* Cleaning up our code to make it more efficient.
Going back through our endpoints and changing any deprecated functions.
* Adding further options for API calls Ie. filtering, searching, etc...
Creating new endpoints that allow for further *customizations* of searches into the database through our API.
* Working on the deployment features of the API to allow for smooth connections.
Going through the resources provided in the course to optimize our deployment.
* Making sure that our deployment to Heroku runs smoothly without crashing, when
there is a lot of site traffic.

Note: As of Feb 10 the group decided to deploy with Heroku.
