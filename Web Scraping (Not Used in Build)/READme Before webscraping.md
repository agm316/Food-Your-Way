The notebook is within the project as a common place for the Software Engineering Course to follow our 
progress on the work. Any normal production team would never use this place to hold this notebook or anything
related to the web scraping meant to be done with the python in this folder.

The python notebook is purely for developing a web scraper and should be run offline purely to collect data.
That data can then be put into the database as added information to make the product more expansive for the consumer.

THE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE BACKEND BUILD

## !! SHOULD BE RUN OFFLINE AND INDEPENDENTLY FROM BUILD !!
