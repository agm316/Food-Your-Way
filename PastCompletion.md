# What we have completed in the past semester:
* Connected MongoDB to hmtl interface using python API\
  We did this by using the MongoDB library and using flask to create a server that can interact with the database.
* Used Docker to spin up instance of MongoDB locally on program run\
  Created Docker config file to specify the connection of the database to our program.
* AND connected mongoDB to the cloud to have options in database hosting\
  We created an account on Mongo Atlas and uploaded our database files in order to ensure there is always a working connection.
* Used pytest to check validity of our code \
  Continually updated and maintained our test file to ensure that all new functions were working and met requirements.
* Implemented HATEAOS support for command line interaction with API\
  Added the necessary endpoints to have an instance of HATEAOS be able to connect allowing for more possible connections to our server.
* Added both an endpoint to webscrape further information and a standalone script\
  Did this using python beautifulsoup4 and collected the information from Allrecipes.com in order to populate database.
